      As described by Wikipedia and Mozilla:
      Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional based vector graphics.
      A vector image is a visual image that consists of a set of geometric shapes like points, curves, lines and polygons.
      Complex shapes can be formed combining these basic shapes.
      Compared to classic bitmapped image formats such as JPEG or PNG, SVG-format vector images can be rendered at any size without loss of quality!
      
  
      SVG is a W3C recommendation standard. SVG images can be created with tools like Inkscape or Adobe,
      but can also be used inline in HTML.
      It has its own set of 'DOM' elements that can be manipulated with a SVG specific Web API in JavaScript.
    -->

  <div id="root">
    <h2>SVG only column chart</h2>
    <!-- We start by defining an svg container element with a couple of attributes:
        -  a 'version' 1.1 and a xml namespace 'xmlns' attribute 
        -  a width and height to make our 'drawing area' a square of 400 by 400 (pixels)
    -  a class 'my-graphic'. The style.css is used to make the svg a block element and center in on screen with display: block; margin: 0 auto;

    TIP: it is a good idea to see what you have created in the browser after every step and use inspect element to examine the DOM.
    Note1: if you don't supply a width and height to the SVG container, a default of 300 x 150 (pixels) will be used in all browsers. 
    Note2: In the most basic case one pixel in an SVG document maps to one pixel on the output device (a.k.a. the screen). One user unit equals one screen unit.

      <!-- TODO: 1. creating elements and defining their width and height
        A rect element can be used to draw, you guessed it, rectangles.
          - create a rect element with a 'width' attribute of 40 and a 'height' attribute of 200 (pixels)
          - give the rect the color '#294899' using the 'fill' attribute

        Note: Pretend this rect is actually our 'woensdag' column. So we set the value of 'woensdag' (66) equal to 200 px in our SVG view.
        Note2: Our SVG is 400 by 400 px, but we will make our chart max 300 pixels in height and ~320 pixels in width.
      -->

      <!-- TODO: 2. positioning different elements on the grid
        Positioning basically works by providing x and y coordinates that the element should start and sometimes end at.
        x determines the position left to right where 0 is to the far left, and y determines the position from top to bottom where 0 is the absolute top.
        Where the drawing of an element begins however, depends on the 'basic shape' you are using (rect, circle, line, etc.)
        
        Rects are drawn from the top left, so to calculate where the bottom right will be,
        you need to add the x and y position to the width and height. 
        For example, if you have a rect width=100 and height=200 and x=20 and y=40, 
        the top left will be at position x 20 and y 40 and the bottom right will be at x 20 + 100 and y 40 + 200
          - use the x and y attributes on the rect to position it exactly in the middle of svg
          - now adjust the y to position the rect 50px above the bottom 
          - add two more rects to the left and two to the right of the existing one that represent the other days in our dataset
            - every rect should have the same width
            - put 10px of room between the rects
            - calculate what the height of the other rects should (approximately) be, 
              based on their value in the dataset and the fact that 'woensdag' is 200px in height.
            - lastly, we want 'woensdag' to stand out in the chart because it is important (for some reason).
              Do this by giving it a different color 'green'
        
        Tip: are your bars 'hanging from the ceiling' by any chance?
        Remember y position 0 is at the top of the svg an the rect is drawn from the top left.
        If you can't figure this out, ask you teacher to help.
      -->

      <!-- TODO: 3. adding a line element
        You should have five vertical bars next to eachother, now lets use a line element to draw our x-axis.
        The line element draws a straight line from point a to point b. The starting point a has an x and y position as does the ending point b.
          - add a line element and define its starting point a with x1 and y1. Set the starting point exactly at the bottom left of your left most rectangle
          - define point b where the line should end with x2 and y2. Set the end of the line exactly at the bottom right of your right most rectangle
          - inspect the DOM and wonder why your line is not visible on screen :)
       -->

      <!-- TODO: 4. adding borders to our elements
         Elements can be surrounded by borders the same as in HTML, but with the 'stroke' attribute.
         A stroke is actually needed to make lines and paths visible on screen.
         As we just saw, the line itself is not visible as it has no 'height' and its height can also not be changed.
         That is why we need to add a stroke to the line.
         The 'stroke' attribute determines the color of the.. stroke, and the stroke-width attribute determines it's size.
          - add a 'stroke' attribute to the line element and make it 'red'
          - add a 'stroke-width' attribute to the line element and set it to 1.
          - are your bars now standing on top of the line? They should be, so fix it if they are not ;)
          - play around with the width of the stroke and see what happens on screen.
            Notice the line still has a height of 0 and that the stroke is drawn AROUND (position of) the line

          - create another line for our y-axis, this time make it vertical, 300px long, which is the max height of our bars, 
            and position it exactly to the left of our first rectangle
          - the lines should be 'connecting' to eachother, if they our not fix it by adjusting x and y

          Our y-axis is now 'hugging' our first bar which is a kinda ugly. 
          Luckily, when creating a category based column chart (which is what we are doing), 
          we change the x-axis and position without changing its meaning or values.
          To make it look a little bit more appealing, we will add some 'padding' to our x-axis.
          We already added a padding between the bars of 10 pixels (1/4th of a column), the padding on the outside must also be 10px
          - position the starting point of the x-axis 10 pixels to the left and the ending point 10 pixels to the right,
            effectively making it 20 pixels longer
          - position the y-axis 10 pixels to the left so the axis lines ar aligned again
         -->

      <!-- TODO: 5. adding text to the equation 
        Text element can also be positioned with the x and y attributes, colored with the 'fill' attribute and can even have a border with the 'stroke' attribute.
        You can further manipulate the appearance of the text with attributes similar to those of HTML/CSS,
        like font-size, font-weight, font-weight and font-family.
        Positioning the text with x and y determines the STARTING point (top left) of the text.
        Hence, positioning the text element in the center of the svg will not display the text exactly in the middle, because the x and y position are used as STARTING point. 
        The text can be aligned however, by setting the 'text-anchor' attribute to 'start', 'middle' or 'end' with a default of start.
        text-anchor alignes the text horizontal and the 'dominant-baseline' attribute alignes it vertical with 'auto', 'middle' and 'hanging' as its most used values.
          - create a text element with the text 'ma'. The actual text is defined as a child of the text element, between the opening and closing tag.
          - use the 'fill', 'font-weight' and 'font-size' attributes to give the text a color red, make it bold and size 14
          - position the text  with x and y, with the same y value as the horizontal line and the same x value as the first column
          - the text should now be 'standing' on top of the horizontal line and at the bottom left of the first bar. 
            Use the 'dominant-baseline' attribute to align the text so it is 'hanging' beneath the line
          - create a text element for each bar di, wo, do, vr and position them beneath the right bar
        -->

      <!-- TODO: 6. use a group to move all our text elements 
        Our text elements are NOT perfectly centered beneath our columns (if you did it right ;)).
        We could manipulate every element separately to make them position perfectly, but it is way nicer if we could move them all at once.
        Well, we can! With the SVG group element 'g'. A group element does not represent a visual entity in SVG but only groups other elements.
        You can't give a group element a height, width, x or y but you cán use other attributes that are inherited by the group's child elements.
        Even though you can't position a g element, you can 'transform' the whole group just like in CSS.
        - add a g element around all the text elements you created, so the text elements become child elements of the g element
        - add a 'transform' attribute to the g element with the value 'translate(20, 0)'. This will push the whole group 20px to the right
        - now all text elements START exactly in the middle of each bar, but to actually center them beneath the bars we need to set text-anchor to middle on each of them
          luckily, we can just do this by setting it on the group element and all the text elements will inherit this property. So set the attribute text-anchor to middle on the g element.
        - you can move all the properties that are the same for each text element to the group element. So do it!! Do it now!!!

        Tip: you can get rid of the y position also, by altering the g elements transform/translate
      -->

      <!-- TODO: 7. now add the vertical y axis
        We're almost done with our static svg column chart but we still need values on our y-axis.
        These values along an axis line are called 'ticks'.
        The y-axis should have eleven ticks: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100.
        Starting with 0 at the exact bottom of the vertical line (y=350) and 100 at the exact top (y=50).
        The elements should be positioned to the left of the vertical line (using text-anchor) 
        and evenly distributed along the length of the line (manually calculate the space between each tick). 
        See if you can manage all this without me telling you the steps to take ;)
      -->

      <!-- TODO Extra: add gridlines to make the bar values more readable
        You can add horizontal lines, usually dotted, that originate at each tick on the y-axis and end at the same x position as the x-axis end point.
        A line can be made 'dotted' by adding a stroke-dasharray attribute to it.
        Use a group element and make sure the lines are positioned BEHIND the bars.
        Well, what are you waiting for. Go create some gridlines.
